#### MelodyMatch: A Cosine-Similarity Content-Based Music Recommendation System

## Overview

**MelodyMatch** is a sophisticated content-based music recommendation system that leverages machine learning and Spotify’s API to deliver highly personalized music recommendations. This project showcases expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and API integration, providing a valuable tool for music enthusiasts seeking tailored playlists.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Skillfully handled complex datasets by cleaning and normalizing artist and song metadata. This involved dealing with various data formats and inconsistencies, ensuring the data's integrity.
  - **Genre Extraction**: Implemented advanced text processing techniques to extract and standardize music genres, enhancing the accuracy of genre-based recommendations.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert genre information into numerical features, allowing for effective similarity computation.
  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables like year and popularity, which are crucial for understanding song characteristics and user preferences.
  - **Normalization**: Normalized numerical features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the recommendation process, improving the system's performance.

- **Spotify API Integration**:
  - **OAuth Authentication**: Set up secure authentication with Spotify’s API using OAuth, demonstrating the ability to manage API credentials and user data securely.
  - **Playlist Fetching**: Fetched and processed user playlists to tailor recommendations based on actual user preferences, showcasing the ability to work with external APIs.

- **Recommendation Generation**:
  - **Playlist Vectorization**: Summarized playlists into feature vectors with a recency bias, ensuring that recent songs have a higher impact on recommendations.
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Used cosine similarity to compare song features and generate top recommendations, illustrating expertise in similarity measures and machine learning techniques.

- **Visualization**:
  - **Cover Art Display**: Implemented visualizations to display album cover art from user playlists, enhancing user interaction and providing a more engaging experience.
